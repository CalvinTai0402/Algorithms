This is a summary of the space-time complexity of the popular data structures:

1)Array
-Initialize:    O(N) S, O(N) T 
-Get:           O(1) S, O(1) T
-Set:           O(1) S, O(1) T
-Traverse:      O(1) S, O(N) T
-Copy:          O(N) S, O(N) T
-Insert:        O(1) S, O(N) T Why O(N) T? Recall that to insert, the OS has to copy the entire array, add 1 unit, then find some space for it.
-Deletion:      O(1) S, O(N) T
-Pop:           O(1) S, O(1) T Popping means removing an element at the end of an array.
